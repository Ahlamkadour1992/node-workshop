# Build your own Node.js project!


Today you'll be building your very own platform to write blog posts. You will be able to write blog posts and save them.

This is often referred to as a **content management system** (CMS).

At the start of each step, you will need to 'checkout' to a new branch on Git.  
At the top of your instructions you'll see something like this:

```
git checkout [name of a particular branch]
```

Make sure to checkout to the relevant branch before continuing.
