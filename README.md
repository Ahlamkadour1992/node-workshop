## What

Build your own Node.js project

Today you'll be building your very own platform to write blog posts. You will be able to write blog posts and save them.

This is often referred to as a **content management system** (CMS).

## How

At the start of each step, you will need to 'checkout' to a new branch on Git.  
At the top of your instructions you'll see something like this:

```bash
git checkout [name of a particular branch]
git merge [name of previous branch]
```

Make sure to checkout to the relevant branch before continuing.

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough.  Try to resist the urge to copy and paste - you will learn **much** more if you get into the habit of typing things out.

You might want to test out small bits of code and run them before adding it to your project.  For this, you can use [repl.it](https://repl.it/) if you like.


Your mentor is there to help you.  Don't let them die of boredom - talk to them and ask questions!
