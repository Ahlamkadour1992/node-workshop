# Node Workshop

Build your own Node.js project

Today you'll be building your very own platform to write blog posts. You will be able to write blog posts and save them.

This is often referred to as a **content management system** (CMS).

This is a tutorial to get you started with Node.js.  At the end of the tutorial, there are optional stretch goals to introduce more advanced concepts.


## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into a number of steps. At the end of each segment, you should find a link to continue onto the next step.

The steps start off introducing you to how Node works.  In the last two steps, there are some mini challenges, requiring some problem-solving.  But you'll definitely have all the knowledge you need to complete it!

You will see code snippets throughout the walkthrough. Try to resist the urge to copy and paste - you will learn much more if you get into the habit of typing things out. If you want to test out small bits of code before adding them to your project, [repl.it](repl.it) is a useful tool.

Feel free to chat to a mentor, or collaborate with your neighbour whenever you need.
