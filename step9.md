# Step 9 - Build the CMS!

```bash
git checkout step9
git merge step8
 ```

You'll see that there's a new public folder with different files.  Run the server to see what the CMS looks like!


*Everything is broken...*

Fix it!  

Your job is to write a new server and handler.  You'll serve the public assets and handle any embedded requests in the `index.html`.


Good luck!  Remember, work with your team and chat with your mentor!
